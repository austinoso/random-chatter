Chatter (still figuring out the name) is a web app similar to Omegle and Chatroulette where you get to talk to random strangers on the internet.

I developed this project to gain an understanding for Firebase. This app uses both Firestore and Realtime DB from Firebase.

# Technologies Used

### Front-end
* React.js
* Material-UI (for styling)

### Back-end
* Firebase (Realtime DB and Firestore)
